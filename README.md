# Stablecoins Market Cap Data Pipeline

A robust Python pipeline that fetches **daily** historical market capitalization data for major stablecoins from the CoinGecko API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

**Data Coverage**: Last 365 days (CoinGecko free tier limitation)

## Features

- **Daily Data Collection**: Fetches the last 365 days of daily historical data for 6 major stablecoins
- **Free Tier Optimized**: Works within CoinGecko's free tier limitations (365 days, 30 calls/minute)
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respects CoinGecko's free tier limits (30 calls/minute)
- **Data Quality Validation**: Implements price range validation and anomaly detection
- **Robust Error Handling**: Continues processing other coins if one fails
- **Database Optimization**: Uses UPSERT operations and batch inserts for efficiency
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging, retry logic, and transaction management

## üìä Supported Stablecoins

| Coin        | Symbol | CoinGecko ID  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Tether      | USDT   | `tether`      |

```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The pipeline creates a table `stablecoin_market_caps` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stablecoin_market_caps (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    coin_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- CoinGecko coin ID
    coin_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,        -- Human readable name
    coin_symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,       -- Token symbol (USDT, USDC, etc.)
    timestamp_utc TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,     -- UTC timestamp (daily)
    market_cap_usd NUMERIC(20,2),          -- Market cap in USD
    price_usd NUMERIC(12,6),               -- Price in USD
    volume_24h_usd NUMERIC(20,2),          -- 24h volume in USD
    data_granularity VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'daily', -- Always 'daily'
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT unique_coin_timestamp UNIQUE(coin_id, timestamp_utc)
);
```

## üìà Data Quality Features

### Price Validation

- Validates stablecoin prices are within $0.90 - $1.10 range
- Logs price anomalies for investigation
- Continues processing despite anomalies

### Data Integrity

- Uses `NUMERIC` data types to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Implements UPSERT logic to handle duplicate data
- Validates market cap values are positive

### Error Handling

- Continues processing other coins if one fails
- Implements exponential backoff for API retries
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting

- **Free Tier**: 2.1 second delay between requests (30 calls/minute)
- **Data Limitation**: Free tier limited to last 365 days of historical data
- **Estimated Runtime**: ~2-3 minutes for 365-day data backfill of all 6 coins
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for rate limits

### Database Optimization

- Batch inserts with 1,000 record pages
- Transaction management with rollback on errors
- Efficient indexing for daily time-series query performance
- Daily data granularity reduces storage requirements and improves query speed
- Smaller dataset (365 days vs years) means faster processing and queries

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**

   ```
   ‚ùå Failed to connect to database: connection failed
   ```

   - Verify your Supabase credentials in `.env`
   - Check if your IP is allowed in Supabase settings
   - Ensure the database is running

2. **Rate Limited by CoinGecko**

   ```
   ‚è≥ Rate limited, waiting 60 seconds...
   ```

   - This is normal for free tier usage
   - The pipeline will automatically retry

3. **Missing Environment Variables**
   ```
   Missing required environment variables: SUPABASE_DB_HOST
   ```
   - Ensure all required variables are set in `.env`
   - Copy from `env.example` and fill in your values

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, modify the logging level in the script:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Change from INFO to DEBUG
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)
```

## üìä Example Queries

### Get Market Cap per Week per Coin

Here we use the rank function to remove possible duplicated days.

```sql
WITH temp as (
    select *
    from stablecoin_market_caps
    where timestamp_utc < (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps)
    order by timestamp_utc desc
)
select
 coin_name,
 coin_id,
 date_trunc('week', timestamp_utc) as week,
 sum(market_cap_usd) as market_cap
from temp
WHERE timestamp_utc = (
    SELECT max(timestamp_utc)
    FROM temp m2
    WHERE m2.coin_id = temp.coin_id
    AND date_trunc('week', m2.timestamp_utc) = date_trunc('week', temp.timestamp_utc)
)
group by 1,2,3
order by 3 desc;
```

### Get Current Volume

```sql
WITH temp as (
    select *,
    RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
    from stablecoin_market_caps
    where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps)  = timestamp_utc::date
)
select sum(volume_24h_usd) as total_current_volume
from temp
where rank = 1;
```

### Get Volume Percentage Change

```sql
WITH current_cap as (
    WITH temp as (
        select *,
        RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
        from stablecoin_market_caps
        where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps)  = timestamp_utc::date
    )
    select sum(volume_24h_usd) as current_total
    from temp
    where rank = 1
),
previous_cap as (
    WITH temp as (
        select *,
        RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
        from stablecoin_market_caps
        where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps) - interval '1 month'  = timestamp_utc::date
    )
    select sum(volume_24h_usd) as previous_total
    from temp
    where rank = 1
)
select
    current_total,
    previous_total,
    ((current_total - previous_total) / previous_total * 100) as percentage_change
from current_cap, previous_cap;
```

### Get Market Cap Percentage Change

Here we use the rank function to remove possible duplicated days.

```sql
WITH current_cap as (
    WITH temp as (
        select *,
        RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
        from stablecoin_market_caps
        where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps)  = timestamp_utc::date
    )
    select sum(market_cap_usd) as current_total
    from temp
    where rank = 1
),
previous_cap as (
    WITH temp as (
        select *,
        RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
        from stablecoin_market_caps
        where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps) - interval '1 month'  = timestamp_utc::date
    )
    select sum(market_cap_usd) as previous_total
    from temp
    where rank = 1
)
select
    current_total,
    previous_total,
    ((current_total - previous_total) / previous_total * 100) as percentage_change
from current_cap, previous_cap;
```

### Get Current Market Cap

Here we use the rank function to remove possible duplicated days.

```sql
WITH temp as (
    select *,
    RANK() OVER (partition by coin_id ORDER BY timestamp_utc) as rank
    from stablecoin_market_caps
    where (select date_trunc('day',max(timestamp_utc)) from stablecoin_market_caps)  = timestamp_utc::date
)
select sum(market_cap_usd) as total_current_market_cap
from temp
where rank = 1
```

## üîÑ Re-running the Pipeline

The pipeline is designed to be idempotent:

- **UPSERT Logic**: Safely handles duplicate data
- **Incremental Updates**: Only new data is added
- **Data Validation**: Maintains data quality on re-runs

To update with latest data, simply run the pipeline again:

```bash
python stablecoin_data_pipeline.py
```
